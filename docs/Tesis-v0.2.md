    -   The game is set on a World War II German Nazi Laboratory, which
        has been recently attacked by the Allied Forces. The player
        plays as an anonymous war prisoner that has been subject to
        various experiments. The story begins when a bomb is dropped on
        the laboratory where the main character is prisoner. However,
        the price for freedom came at a higher expense than what he
        thought. The main character realizes that the bombing not only
        left him as the sole human survivor, but there's something else
        that won't let him go so easily.

15. **Story Design**

    -   Jashel Rosner was one of the finest tailors in Düsseldorf. Due
        to his religion and beliefs he was pursued and captured by the
        German Nazi Army and taken to the Emslandlager labor camp. After
        being one of the few survivors in his block he was transferred
        to Sachsenhausen, a concentration camp known by certain
        experimental practices on prisoners. The only thing that kept
        him alive through 2 years of experiments was his fate in
        reuniting again with his family again. Its 1945, the Allied air
        force starts an attack using bombs and for Rosner's luck one of
        them dropped at the exact moment a new round of experiments was
        going to start on him. That bomb left him unconscious for some
        time, until a crack on the water system generates a flood on the
        room. The moment when the water rises enough to touch Rosner's
        feet makes him snap and wake up. The light bulb makes him dazzle
        for a while. He realizes that everyone on the room is dead
        except for him and before someone crosses the door he must
        escape. Rosner hears something in the distance, "Are those
        screams?", he asks himself. Luckily for him, the restrains on
        his left hand were ripped apart without any damage. He proceeds
        to untie his left hand and feet. Water is raising fast and he
        must move quickly if he wants to leave the room alive, because
        electricity controls are at his hips height and currently the
        water level is currently halfway of his shinbone. The only
        problem is that the electricity controls are located on the side
        room where scientists were monitoring his reactions to the
        experiments. He manages to unlock his right hand and his feet
        after that. The experiment director was floating just in front
        of him as he finally got up from the chair.
