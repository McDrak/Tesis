### 2. The Project
The purpose of the game is to give an immersive experience to the player, where his/her field of vision will constantly shrink until the player is forced to play being completely blind. At that stage, the player should trust on his hearing and touch (Through joystick vibrations) senses to follow the storyline, solve puzzles and escape rooms.

### 3. State of the Project
+ ~~Graduate Project Proposal (Done)~~
+ ~~Graduate Project Aproval (APROVED!!)~~
+ Change of Purpose (Currently adjusting the Design Document for Magister Degree Project Proposal) *

### 4. Name Justification
"La Forge" comes from [Geordi La Forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge) a [Star Trek: The Next Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation) character who has been blind since birth and uses technological devices to allow him to see (That are very similar to nowadays VR's HMDs).

###### \*Due to the number of members requirement not fulfilled before the Graduate Project Confirmation deadline i had to switch project and change the purpose of this project.
